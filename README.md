# ARTIFICAIL-FACE-GENRATION-USING-DCGAN
Artificial Faces Generation using DCGAN is an enhanced Generative Deep Learning project made possible with the usage of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). The model basically comprises of two modules â€“ Generator & Discriminator. The Generator is initially trained on a Celeb Dataset and outputs new artificial faces. The discriminator takes in the Generator outputs and Celeb images and makes an attempt to detect the fake (artificial) images. 

An epoch battle takes place between the Generator and Discriminator to increase the quality and preciseness of the generated images. This is conveniently accomplish by the usage of a loss function. During the initial epochs, the images are quite distorted and blurry. But they grew well refined and pixelated as training epochs increases. 

The expected output images of the trained GAN are expected to resemble natural human faces being artificially made.
